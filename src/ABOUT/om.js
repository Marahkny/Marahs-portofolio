<p className="about-text py-3">
Ten years ago, I was a math teacher in Damascus, where I discovered my passion for solving problems and finding creative solutions. I dreamed of learning coding and design to apply that same problem-solving mindset in new ways. After moving to Sweden, I decided to pursue an education that combined these interests.
